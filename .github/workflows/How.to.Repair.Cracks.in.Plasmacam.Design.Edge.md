## What Causes Cracks in Plasmacam Design Edge?
 
There are several possible causes of cracks in Plasmacam Design Edge, such as:
 
- **File format:** If you import a file from another program, such as Adobe Illustrator, it may not be compatible with Plasmacam Design Edge. You should always save your files as DXF format before importing them to Plasmacam Design Edge.
- **Cut settings:** If you use incorrect or inappropriate cut settings, such as speed, amperage, pierce time, etc., you may cause overheating or underheating of the metal, which can result in cracks. You should always follow the cut charts provided by your plasma cutter manufacturer and adjust your settings according to the material thickness and type.
- **Air supply:** If you have insufficient or inconsistent air supply to your plasma cutter, you may affect the quality of the plasma arc and the cut. You should always check your air pressure at the entrance of the plasma cutter while cutting and make sure it is around 100 psi. You should also use an inline filter to remove any moisture or contaminants from the air.
- **Torch movement:** If you have a delay or a gap between the torch firing and moving, you may create incomplete cuts or overcuts. You should always enable the "Wait for signal before moving" option in your machine control settings and set the proper time to pierce path value from the cut chart.

If you notice any cracks in your cut paths, you can try to repair them using the following steps:

1. **Identify the cracks:** You can use the intersection error process to find any gaps or overlaps in your cut paths. To do this, go to Edit > Convert > Convert to Cut Paths. Then click on Check for Intersection Errors. This will highlight any errors with a green line above them.
2. **Edit the cut paths:** You can use the node editing tool to modify or delete any nodes that cause cracks. To do this, select the cut path with the error and click on Edit Nodes. Then you can drag, add, delete, or smooth any nodes as needed. You can also use the offset tool to adjust the kerf width of your cut paths.
3. **Test the cut:** You can use the simulate mode to preview how your design will be cut before wasting any metal. To do this, go to File > Simulate Mode. Then click on Start Simulation. This will show you how your torch will move along the cut paths and alert you of any errors or warnings.
4. **Cut the design:** Once you are satisfied with your design and settings, you can proceed to cut your design on metal. To do this, go to File > Cut Mode. Then click on Start Cutting. Make sure your plasma cutter is turned on and connected to your computer and table.
